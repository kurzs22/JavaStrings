# Java Strings

## 💪Challenge
You can not use some characters within a string literal in Java directly. To add these special characters in a string, you have to use an escape character sequence but you can also use the unicode escape sequence. Look up the unicode for all of the eight special characters that you usually write down with the escape sequence. Print the character and the length of the string with that character.

The String class provides methods to convert a string to all uppercase or all lowercase. What happens with special characters, e.g. the german Umlaut ("ä"), the accents popular in france ("é") or the danish letter "Ø".

Try out the valueOf methods on all primitive data types and compare the length of the output, the number of bytes of the output and the number of bytes for the primitive data type.

Write a method that splits a string with a sentence into words and reverses the order of the words.

Write a method that splits a string with a sentence into words and reverses the order of the characters in each word while maintaining the order of the words in the sentence.
